# How to get started with Ethereum blockchain development

## Using Truffle Suite and React

## Prerequisites:
* Node JS
* Understanding of React framework
* Understanding of command-line
* Terminal of choice

## How to begin
1. Install truffle. We're going to install truffle globally, using npm. Enter into your terminal:

    `npm install -g truffle`

1. Make a directory for your new project and navigate to your new directory:

    `mkdir truffle-example`

    `cd truffle-example`

1. Unbox a truffle box. We're going to use one called drizzle. There are many other boxes available too: https://www.trufflesuite.com/boxes

    `truffle unbox drizzle`

1. Let's see what we have. Open the contents in your text editor of choice. For example, I'm using vs-code `code` command:

    `code .`


    ## (Brief explanation on what we have inside our unboxed drizzle project)

1. Open a new terminal window and navigate into our React app:

    `cd app`

1. Start the react app running locally on your computer:

    `npm start`

    you should see a loading... message because there is no blockchain to connect to. Let's get one running locally on our computer using [ganache-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ganache-cli)

## Use ganache-cli to run a local blockchain

1. Open a new terminal window. We're going to install ganache-cli globally:

    `npm install -g ganache-cli`


1. Run ganache-cli to get a local ethereum blockchain running on your computer. 

    `ganache-cli`

    when successful, this command will provide you with 10 available accounts and corresponding private keys, each account with 100 ETH. Will also provide a mneumonic or 12-word phrase.The blockchain will listen on port 8545

1. Let's copy this 12-word mneumonic and create a command to run our blockchain as deterministic and mnemonic:

    in our code editor, we are going to edit our package.json inside our truffle-example directory. We are going to create a command called `ganache` to run our blockchain and persist it to a db. In this example, I'm using the mneumonic: 'picture tray motion shuffle action fun puzzle velvet sample trip reject beef' but you can use the mneumonic that was generated by your ganache-cli or another mneumonic as you please. Other projects should use a different mneumonic or different networkId to generate a unique blockchain. We will need to run ganache-cli with the following flags:

    * `-d` or `--deterministic`: Generate deterministic addresses based on a pre-defined mnemonic.

    * `-m` or `--mnemonic`: Use a bip39 mnemonic phrase for generating a PRNG seed, which is in turn used for hierarchical deterministic (HD) account generation.

    * `--db`: Specify a path to a directory to save the chain database. If a database already exists, ganache-cli will initialize that chain instead of creating a new one.

    * `-i` or `--networkId`: Specify the network id ganache-cli will use to identify itself (defaults to the current time or the network id of the forked blockchain if configured)

    full documentation for ganache-cli can be found here: https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli#readme

    Here is the command I'm using for this example

    `ganache-cli -d -m picture tray motion shuffle action fun puzzle velvet sample trip reject beef --db ./ganache_db -i 1`

    Your package.json file should now have 2 scripts we can run with npm: `test` and `ganache`
    ```
    "scripts": {
        "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
        "ganache": "ganache-cli -d -m picture tray motion shuffle action fun puzzle velvet sample trip reject beef --db ./ganache_db -i 1"
    },
    ```

1. Now every time we run this command our blockchain will remember all our past changes, users and save the history to our 'database' directory. cd to our drizzle-example and run our new command:

    `cd truffle-example`

    `npm run ganache`

    notice that a directory is created in our root directory called `ganache_db` as we described in our command. This is where blockchain history will be stored. We can add this file to our .gitignore to prevent from commiting this directory.

    end the process and re-run the command. Make sure the Available Accounts and Private Keys are identical every time you run the command.

1. Now that we have our blockchain running locally, we are ready to install Metamask to connect our accounts to our frontend application.
